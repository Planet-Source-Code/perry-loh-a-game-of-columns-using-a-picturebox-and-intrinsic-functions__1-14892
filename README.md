### Description

Started working on this about 6 months ago, and laid dormant on my computer till the last

few days where I actually got to solve some major/minor bugs and actually got it to a playable

state.<br>

This is the first simple game that I've worked on. <br>

Decided to use intrisic functions to keep it simple. Coding this created more logical and code issues rather than

technical issues such as using bitblt/directx<br><br>

Anyway, I'm still tinkering with the code at the moment and adding some more gameplay functions to make it more fun. <br>Stay tuned!
